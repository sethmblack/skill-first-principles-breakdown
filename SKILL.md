# First Principles Breakdown

Reduce complex problems to fundamental truths by stripping away assumptions and conventional wisdom, then rebuild from ground truth - following Naval Ravikant's approach to clear thinking.

**Token Budget:** ~1000 tokens

---

## Constraints
- Do NOT dismiss all conventional wisdom as wrong
- Do NOT use first principles to justify harmful conclusions
- Acknowledge when conventional wisdom is actually correct
- Be honest about uncertainty in fundamental assumptions

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Break this down for me"
- User asks "What's really true here?"
- User is stuck in conventional framing
- User needs to question assumptions
- User faces a decision where "obvious" answers feel wrong

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Problem or decision | Yes | What the user is trying to understand |
| Current framing | Helpful | How the problem is conventionally viewed |
| Constraints | Optional | Real limitations that can't be changed |

---

## The Core Approach

**First principles thinking:** Decompose to fundamental truths, then rebuild.

Most people reason by analogy: "We do it this way because that's how it's done."

First principles reasoning: "What's actually true here, independent of what others think?"

**Key insight:** "Most people are playing games they don't understand with rules they didn't choose."

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Conventional Framing

| Element | Conventional View |
|---------|-------------------|
| Problem | "{How the problem is typically described}" |
| Solution | "{The 'obvious' or standard approach}" |
| Constraints | "{What everyone assumes limits options}" |

### Step 2: Question Each Assumption

For each element of the conventional framing:

| Assumption | Is this fundamental truth or convention? | Evidence |
|------------|------------------------------------------|----------|
| {assumption 1} | Fundamental / Convention | {why} |
| {assumption 2} | Fundamental / Convention | {why} |
| {assumption 3} | Fundamental / Convention | {why} |

Questions to expose assumptions:
- "Is this actually true, or just widely believed?"
- "What would a first-time observer notice that we've stopped seeing?"
- "If we started from scratch, would we design it this way?"
- "What are the physical/logical constraints vs. social constraints?"

### Step 3: Strip to Fundamental Truths

What remains after removing conventions:

| Category | Fundamental Truths |
|----------|-------------------|
| Physical | {laws of physics, resource constraints} |
| Logical | {definitional truths, mathematical facts} |
| Human | {basic needs, incentive structures} |

### Step 4: Rebuild from First Principles

Starting from fundamentals, construct the solution:

1. Given {fundamental truth 1}...
2. And {fundamental truth 2}...
3. The logical approach would be {rebuilt solution}

### Step 5: Compare to Conventional Answer

| Approach | Source | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|----------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Conventional | Analogy/tradition | {pros} | {cons} |
| First Principles | Ground truth | {pros} | {cons} |

## Output Format

```markdown
## First Principles Breakdown

### The Conventional Framing
{How this is typically thought about}

### Assumptions Exposed

| Assumption | Status | Reality |
|------------|--------|---------|
| {assumption} | Convention | {what's actually true} |

### Fundamental Truths
1. {First principle that's actually true}
2. {Second principle that's actually true}
3. {Third principle that's actually true}

### Rebuilt Solution
Given these fundamentals, the approach that makes sense is:
{Solution derived from first principles}

### Why This Differs from Convention
{Explanation of where convention went wrong}

### Caveat
{Where conventional wisdom might actually be right, or what this analysis misses}
```

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**User:** "Everyone says I need to get an MBA to advance in business. Should I spend $200K on business school?"

**Skill Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## First Principles Breakdown

### The Conventional Framing
"MBA = business advancement. Top MBA = top career outcomes. Everyone serious about business gets one."

### Assumptions Exposed

| Assumption | Status | Reality |
|------------|--------|---------|
| MBA teaches business skills | Partially convention | Some skills taught, but mostly signaling and networking |
| Top companies require MBAs | Convention | They require proof of competence; MBA is one proxy |
| $200K investment pays off | Convention | Depends entirely on counterfactual - what else would you do? |
| Two years is necessary | Convention | Same information available in books, courses, experience |

### Fundamental Truths
1. **Business competence comes from building businesses** - not from studying them
2. **Signaling can be achieved multiple ways** - credentials, track record, demonstrations
3. **Network value is real** - but expensive MBA is one of many ways to build it
4. **$200K + 2 years is a resource** - question is best deployment of that resource

### Rebuilt Solution
The MBA is a bundle: education + signaling + network + credential.

First principles question: Can you unbundle this?
- **Education:** $500 in books covers more than the curriculum
- **Signaling:** Building something signals more than a degree
- **Network:** The $200K could fund starting a company where you'd meet better people
- **Credential:** Some paths require it (consulting, some corporations); many don't

If you need the credential for a specific path (McKinsey, traditional corporate), the MBA might be the only route. If you want to build businesses, the MBA is a $200K detour.

### Why This Differs from Convention
Convention confuses correlation with causation. MBA grads succeed often because high-potential people get into MBA programs, not because the programs create success. The selection effect is doing most of the work.

### Caveat
If your specific goal requires the specific credential (certain consulting firms, certain corporate paths), first principles doesn't override practical gatekeeping. Know the game you're playing.

## Integration

This skill is part of the Naval Ravikant expert. After breakdown, consider:

- **Specific Knowledge Discovery** - Apply first principles to career questions
- **Wealth vs. Status Diagnosis** - Is conventional path about wealth or status?
- **Leverage Audit** - Does rebuilt solution apply more leverage?

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| User wants to reject all convention | Caution - some convention encodes wisdom |
| First principles leads to same answer | Acknowledge convention is sometimes right |
| Analysis paralysis risk | Decide with principles, then act |
| Fundamental truths are disputed | Note uncertainty, analyze multiple scenarios |
